            <p>SecretSociety is the legion that my two main Israphel Elyos characters, Deltavolt and Spirituner, are currently in. The legion is led by Cybrodeath, a templar. The legion occasionally holds legion events and instance runs. Although there can sometimes be times when no one else is online, the legion is still recruiting and growing, and most of the legion members get to know everyone else better.</p>
